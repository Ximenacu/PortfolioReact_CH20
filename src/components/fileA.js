            <p>
              Hello! My name is Ximena. I am a Mexican Web Developer with a background in Engineering, Math, English, and Teaching all the latter.
              I decided to make a career switch in 2022 after working as a Design Engineer for a year. It was then that I realized coding allowed me 
              to solve more interesting problems and provided an opportunity to explore my creative side and express myself through front-end development.<br/>
              <br/>
              I have worked hard to become a reliable, proactive leader that pays attention to detail and cares about people. 
              I am passionate and hungry for knowledge. In love with the arts and nature. Concerned about the state of our world, always seeking ways to make it better.
              <br/> Currently obsessed with audiobooks, concerts and trying new things. 
              I am seeking opportunities to develop my full potential, unleash my creativity, learn from professionals, and be a part of interesting and challenging projects that I can proudly show off to everyone.
